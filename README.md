## Hi there 👋

My name is Korel Ucpinar, I am a student at Purdue University with experience in networking, virtualization, and Linux systems! 

I love contributing to open-source projects and I am always looking to leverage my skills in network architecture, Docker, and cloud technologies to create something new or interesting.


<p>
  Pinned are some projects I have worked on! If you want to learn more about them or other projects I have made, please check out my portfolio:  <a href="https://www.korelucpinar.com/" target="_blank">🌐 Korel Ucpinar's Portfolio</a>
